Max A. Alekseyev has been interested in genome arrangement and computational
reconstruction of ancient genome for a long time (For example, check [his 2009
paper with Pavel A.
Pevzner](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2675983/)). He recently
uploaded [a new paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07546) in arxiv that the
readers may find interesting.

> Genome rearrangements are evolutionary events that shuffle genomic
architectures. Most frequent genome rearrangements are reversals,
translocations, fusions, and fissions. While there are some more complex
genome rearrangements such as transpositions, they are rarely observed and
believed to constitute only a small fraction of genome rearrangements
happening in the course of evolution. The analysis of transpositions is
further obfuscated by intractability of the underlying computational problems.

We propose a computational method for estimating the rate of transpositions in
evolutionary scenarios between genomes. We applied our method to a set of
mammalian genomes and estimated the transpositions rate in mammalian evolution
to be around 0.26.

For an early introduction to this topic from Pevzner's group, check the
following PNAS paper from 2003. It is quite an interesting paper challenging
the long-standing random breakage model.

[Human and mouse genomic sequences reveal extensive breakpoint reuse in
mammalian evolution](http://www.pnas.org/content/100/13/7672.full.pdf)

> The human and mouse genomic sequences provide evidence for a

larger number of rearrangements than previously thought and reveal extensive
reuse of breakpoints from the same short fragile regions. Breakpoint
clustering in regions implicated in cancer and infertility have been reported
in previous studies; we report here on breakpoint clustering in chromosome
evolution. This clustering reveals limitations of the widely accepted random
breakage theory that has remained unchallenged since the mid-1980s. The genome
rearrangement analysis of the human and mouse genomes implies the existence of
a large number of very short hidden synteny blocks that were invisible in the
comparative mapping data and ignored in the random breakage model. These
blocks are defined by closely located breakpoints and are often hard to
detect. **Our results suggest a model of chromosome evolution that postulates
that mammalian genomes are mosaics of fragile regions with high propensity for
rearrangements and solid regions with low propensity for rearrangements.**
